<h2>Common Web Application Vulnerabilities in 2023</h2>
<p>Web applications continue to be a prime target for attackers. Here are the most common vulnerabilities we're seeing this year:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Injection flaws (SQLi, Command Injection)</li>
    <li>Broken Authentication</li>
    <li>Sensitive Data Exposure</li>
    <li>XML External Entities (XXE)</li>
    <li>Broken Access Control</li>
</ul>
<p>As a security professional, I recommend regular penetration testing and code reviews to identify these issues before attackers do.</p>
